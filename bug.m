In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises when dealing with memory management and KVO (Key-Value Observing).  Specifically, if an object is deallocated while still being observed, a crash can occur. This is often subtle because the crash might not happen immediately, but only when the observer tries to access the deallocated object.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyObservedObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *observedProperty;
@end

@implementation MyObservedObject
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyObservedObject deallocated");
}
@end

@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary<NSKeyValueChangeKey,id> *)change context:(void *)context {
    // Accessing observedProperty after MyObservedObject is deallocated will crash
    NSLog(@"Observed property changed: %@
", [object observedProperty]);
}
@end

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        MyObservedObject *observedObject = [[MyObservedObject alloc] init];
        observedObject.observedProperty = @"Initial Value";
        
        MyObserver *observer = [[MyObserver alloc] init];
        [observedObject addObserver:observer forKeyPath:@"observedProperty" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:NULL];
        
        observedObject.observedProperty = @"New Value";
        
        // Deallocating the observed object prematurely
        [observedObject release];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `observedObject` is released before the observer has finished processing the KVO notification, leading to a potential crash.  The `dealloc` method is called, but the observer still holds a pointer to the now-deallocated object.
