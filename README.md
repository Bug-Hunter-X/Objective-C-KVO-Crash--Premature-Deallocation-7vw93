This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  When an observed object is deallocated before its observer has finished processing a notification, accessing properties of the deallocated object will result in a crash. The provided example illustrates this scenario and includes a solution to prevent this type of crash.  The solution emphasizes proper handling of KVO notifications and safe removal of observers.
